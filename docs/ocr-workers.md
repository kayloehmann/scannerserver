# Distributed OCR Workers

The distributed OCR feature keeps scannerserver authoritative for scanning, queue ownership,
filenames, cancellation, and final publication. Optional workers register from other computers and
claim leased OCR jobs. Workers initiate every connection so they
do not need a fixed address or an inbound firewall rule.

## How It Works

- The `scannerserver-worker` Swift executable connects to an explicit scannerserver URL or discovers
  `_scannerserver._tcp` through Bonjour on macOS.
- After resolving command-line configuration, identity, and the server URL, the executable composes
  separate control and job HTTP clients plus the job processor and hands the long-running lifecycle
  to `OCRWorkerRuntimeModule` in `ScannerServerCore`. That module owns registration/reconnects,
  approval and disabled waiting, heartbeat supervision, lease dispatch, job activity accounting,
  and approved-session cancellation/recovery. The executable therefore has no independent session
  or leasing loop.
- Each worker creates a persistent ID and authentication token in
  `~/.config/scannerserver-worker/identity.json`.
- Registration reports its name, hostname, architecture, CPU capacity, derived concurrency limit,
  version, and OCR languages.
- New workers require approval on the scannerserver **Workers** page.
- The same page owns the built-in worker's persisted processing CPU allowance and post-scan
  priority: **Normal**, **Niced**, or **Fallback only**. These are worker-wide settings, not
  scan-preset fields, and selector changes apply immediately.
- Heartbeats report liveness and running-job count. Approved workers become offline after missed
  heartbeats. They can be paused temporarily or disabled without forgetting their approval.
- Registrations and approvals are stored atomically in
  `/scans/.scannerserver-ocr-workers.json` by default.
- `OCRWorkerJobStore` provides an atomically persisted manifest and lease state machine at
  `/scans/.scannerserver-ocr-jobs.json`. It supports FIFO capability matching, opaque lease tokens,
  renewal, authenticated terminal transitions, and cancellation. Nonterminal manifests are
  cancelled at scannerserver startup because their owning in-memory queue tasks do not survive a
  restart; this prevents abandoned pages from being leased again.
- `OCRWorkerJobTransferCoordinator` keeps the HTTP layer out of lease and file-publication policy.
  It combines registry authorization with leasing, source path and digest checks, renewal and
  failure transitions, and validated result staging. If cancellation or reassignment changes a
  lease while a result is being validated, the coordinator removes any just-published result and
  preserves the newer durable job state.
- `OCRQueueActor` creates typed OCR requests and gives approved, enabled, compatible workers first
  refusal through `OCRExecutionModule`,
  including when a registered worker is temporarily offline. Capability-aware workers run OCR,
  configured autocrop, and blank-page filtering on each page. It retains FIFO admission, local and
  remote capacity selection, page-task cancellation, and timing. `StreamingOCRDocumentModule`
  receives typed page completions and owns the all-blank keep-one safeguard, naming, ordered
  assembly, verification, origin-specific failure policy, final publication, and workspace cleanup.
  Its finalizer creates only a private staging file; an actor generation check guards the exclusive
  publication commit against cancellation and late results.
- The OCR scheduler fills the aggregate page capacity announced by all online, approved, enabled,
  unpaused workers. With **Normal** or **Niced** priority, the internal worker's local CPU allowance
  is added to that total after remote slots are filled. With **Fallback only**, local slots are not
  reserved while compatible remote capacity is online; local niced processing is used when no
  remote capacity is available or a remote attempt fails. Pausing the internal worker removes local
  fallback altogether without reducing remote concurrency.
  Local fallback and queue-owned preprocessing use one shared CPU permit pool. The queue releases
  preprocessing capacity at the typed OCR handoff and the execution module acquires and releases
  the local OCR reservation, so a worker outage cannot oversubscribe the scanner host.
- Multipage ScanSnap Wi-Fi scans are streamed page by page. Each accepted JPEG is reserved by the
  document actor before asynchronous PDF writing, then wrapped in a one-page PDF and queued before
  the scanner transfers the next page. Completed one-page OCR,
  crop, and blank-filter results are uploaded immediately, retained in the scan workspace, and
  assembled in source order after the feeder is empty. With `SCAN_OCR_ONLY`, the raw `.pdf` stays
  private and is removed once the assembled `.ocr.pdf` is published; if processing fails it is
  published as a fallback instead, and a fallback that cannot be published keeps the workspace and
  reports the error. Without it, the raw `.pdf` is published independently and only
  the all-blank safeguard, creator metadata, and atomic `.ocr.pdf` publication happen after ordered
  assembly.
  The SANE backend remains whole-document because `scanimage` does not expose the same page-arrival
  callback.
- PDFs dropped onto the Documents page are counted and split by the same document module. Each
  prepared page is yielded immediately to the queue and dispatched through the same aggregate
  remote capacity. The uploaded source remains unchanged while completed pages are reassembled in
  order as the sibling `.ocr.pdf`.
- The worker downloads a size- and SHA-256-verified PDF, runs OCRmyPDF plus the native autocrop and
  blank-page implementations directly in worker-container mode or inside the existing image with Apple
  `container` in native macOS mode, and uploads the result through its authenticated lease.
- scannerserver requires a PDF result, calculates its SHA-256 digest, writes it to a same-directory
  staging file, validates it with `qpdf --check`, and atomically publishes the established
  `.ocr.pdf` output name.
- No approved and enabled compatible worker, assignment timeout, or reported worker failure falls
  back to local OCR and the same typed crop/blank operations. Cancellation invalidates the remote
  lease and is never converted into local fallback.
- A worker uses one long-polling lease request at a time and starts page-processing tasks until its
  announced capacity is full. Registration and heartbeats use a separate HTTP session, so many CPU
  slots cannot occupy every connection and make a healthy worker appear stale. The approved-session
  task owns its heartbeat, dispatcher, and in-flight job children as one cancellation tree: a failed
  heartbeat, pause/disable transition, or process cancellation stops the lease poll and every active
  page before the registration loop recovers the session. Individual job failures remain logged and
  reported without terminating other pages or the dispatcher.

## Run A Worker Container

The production image contains both `scannerserver` and `scannerserver-worker`. Start the worker by
overriding the image's default command:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name scannerserver-worker \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cpus 11 \
  --memory 8g \
  --volume scannerserver-worker-state:/home/scansnap/.config/scannerserver-worker \
  gitmaster.jinx.eu/jnxpublic/scannerserver:jinx \
  scannerserver-worker \
  --server http://SCANNERSERVER-IP \
  --name "Mac Studio"
```

The image enables direct execution automatically: OCRmyPDF runs inside the worker container, so no
Docker socket, privileged mode, or nested container is needed. The worker detects Docker's cgroup
CPU allowance; `--cpus 11` therefore advertises and uses 11 CPUs. Its named volume retains the
worker identity and scannerserver approval when the container is replaced.

If scannerserver is another container on the same Docker network, use its service name in
`--server`. To reach a scannerserver published on the Docker host, use
`http://host.docker.internal:PORT` on Docker Desktop.

### Managed Apple Container worker on macOS

macOS users running the complete worker image through Apple's `container` CLI can use the included
launcher. It pulls and recreates the worker on demand, persists its identity in the user's Library,
and can install a LaunchAgent that starts the existing container at login:

```sh
export SCANNERSERVER_WORKER_SERVER_URL=http://SCANNERSERVER-IP
./scripts/scannerserverworker.zsh
./scripts/scannerserverworker.zsh --install
```

Run the first command once before installing the LaunchAgent. It starts Apple Container with kernel
installation enabled, pulls the configured image, and creates the worker. The LaunchAgent starts
that existing container at later logins; it deliberately does not pull or replace images during
login. Rerun the launcher without an option when a new scannerserver image should replace the
worker container, then rerun `--install` only if its recorded settings changed.

The LaunchAgent records the resolved settings, so it does not depend on interactive shell startup
files. By default, the launcher uses the Mac's local host name, reserves one active CPU for macOS,
allocates 8 GB to the worker container, and stores the persistent identity under
`~/Library/Application Support/scannerserver-worker/`. Override those defaults before running the
launcher or installing the LaunchAgent:

```sh
export SCANNERSERVER_WORKER_NAME=office-mac
export SCANNERSERVER_WORKER_CPUS=8
export SCANNERSERVER_WORKER_MEMORY=12G
export SCANNERSERVER_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/jollyjinx/scannerserver:latest
```

Run `./scripts/scannerserverworker.zsh --help` for every override and `--dry-run` to inspect the
resolved `container run` command. The launcher deliberately keeps transient OCR work under the
container's `/tmp`; only the generated worker ID and authentication token are persisted on the Mac.
The LaunchAgent stores the launcher's absolute path, so keep the checkout at that path after
installation. Its combined output is written to
`~/Library/Logs/eu.jinx.scannerserver-worker.log`.

Open the **Workers** page on scannerserver and approve the new worker. Worker capacity is derived
from its detected CPUs: an 11-CPU worker leases up to 11 pages concurrently, and every one-page PDF
runs with one CPU and OCRmyPDF `--jobs 1`. This keeps every CPU busy across pages instead of assigning
idle parallel-page capacity to a one-page PDF. The page includes the scannerserver's internal fallback worker,
highlights processing workers, reports successful page count and average pages per minute, and shows
waiting, running, and recent terminal work in compact lists with document, page, operations, worker,
timing, and result details.

**Pause** temporarily removes a remote worker from dispatch and immediately returns its active
leases to the queue. Another compatible worker can claim them without waiting for lease expiry. The
paused process remains registered and continues heartbeating; if it is still processing an old
lease, its next renewal or upload is rejected and that work is discarded. **Resume** makes it
eligible again. **Disable** remains the administrative off switch.

The internal worker has its own **Pause** and **Resume** controls. Pausing it cancels active local
OCR and keeps that page in the scheduler so a compatible remote worker can take over. While it is
paused, new remote registrations and approvals are detected immediately; if no remote capacity is
available, work waits instead of consuming scannerserver CPU. Resuming permits local fallback
again. This state survives a scannerserver restart. Worker activity refreshes only the live Workers
panel and preserves an active settings control; CPU and priority changes are posted immediately
without a separate Save action.

Deleting a worker removes its persisted registration and approval. If that worker process is still
running, it registers again with the same identity and must be approved again.

Deleting a document cancels its whole streaming batch, removes queued pages, invalidates active
remote leases, and removes the private scan workspace. A late result from a worker is rejected and
cannot recreate the deleted document.

## Native macOS Worker

The native executable remains useful when Apple Container should isolate each OCR job. Start the
Apple Container system, pull the OCR image, and run the worker from this repository:

```sh
container system start
container system kernel set --recommended  # only when no default kernel is configured
container image pull gitmaster.jinx.eu/jnxpublic/scannerserver:jinx
swift run -c release scannerserver-worker \
  --server http://SCANNERSERVER-IP \
  --name "Mac Studio" \
  --cpus 11 \
  --container-image gitmaster.jinx.eu/jnxpublic/scannerserver:jinx \
  --memory-per-job 8G
```

When scannerserver advertises itself through Bonjour, omit `--server`:

```sh
swift run -c release scannerserver-worker \
  --name "Mac Studio" \
  --cpus 11 \
  --container-image gitmaster.jinx.eu/jnxpublic/scannerserver:jinx
```

Set `SCAN_OCR_WORKER_BONJOUR_ENABLED=true` on scannerserver to start the optional
`avahi-publish-service` publisher. Its Avahi daemon must already be reachable. Set
`SCANNERSERVER_BONJOUR_URL` to the URL that Macs can use, particularly when scannerserver's
container hostname is not resolvable on the LAN:

```yaml
environment:
  SCAN_OCR_WORKER_BONJOUR_ENABLED: "true"
  SCANNERSERVER_BONJOUR_URL: "http://scanner-host.local"
```

Bonjour publication is best-effort and does not affect the scanner service if Avahi is missing or
unavailable. Passing `--server` to the worker bypasses discovery completely.

The native command defaults to the active processor count minus one so macOS retains one processor
for interactive work.

Useful worker overrides:

```text
--container-runtime container
--container-image gitmaster.jinx.eu/jnxpublic/scannerserver:jinx
--memory-per-job 8G
--max-concurrent-jobs 4
--workspace ~/Library/Caches/scannerserver-worker/jobs
--direct-ocr
```

`--max-concurrent-jobs` is an optional safety cap for memory- or thermally constrained machines.
When omitted, it defaults to the detected CPU count. The former `--jobs` spelling remains accepted
as a hidden compatibility alias but is deprecated. Whole-document jobs are still valid, but use one
CPU per document; the optimized ScanSnap Wi-Fi path dispatches one-page jobs.

Stop a foreground native worker with Control-C. Its identity remains in
`~/.config/scannerserver-worker/identity.json`, so it does not need approval again.

The API accepts HTTP because the main service has no TLS termination contract. Worker and lease
tokens authenticate every document operation, but document bytes are not encrypted over plain HTTP.
Run this only on a trusted LAN or put scannerserver behind HTTPS before using an untrusted network.

## Protocol

The current protocol version is `1`:

```text
POST /api/ocr-workers/register
POST /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/heartbeat
POST /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/jobs/lease
GET  /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/jobs/{job-id}/source
POST /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/jobs/{job-id}/renew
POST /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/jobs/{job-id}/result
POST /api/ocr-workers/{worker-id}/jobs/{job-id}/fail
GET  /api/ocr-workers
```

The browser approval, pause/resume, enable/disable, and delete controls use server-rendered form
routes under `/workers/{worker-id}/...`; internal fallback pause/resume and settings use
`/internal-worker/...`.
The public listing contains worker metadata and status but never authentication tokens.

Remote manifests may carry optional document, batch, page, and operation metadata. Older persisted
jobs without these fields remain decodable. ScanSnap Wi-Fi page sharding preserves source order and
publishes the assembled `.ocr.pdf` only when every page has completed successfully. On failure with
`SCAN_OCR_ONLY`, the private raw PDF is published as a fallback before the scan workspace is
removed; if that fallback cannot be published, the workspace is kept and the error is reported.
Cancellation removes the workspace without publishing it. Without `SCAN_OCR_ONLY`, the raw PDF is
already published independently and is never replaced.
