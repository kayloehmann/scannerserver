# Agent documentation

Use [docs/index.md](../docs/index.md) as the authoritative documentation map. This `AI/` entry point makes the established front-matter documentation discoverable to repository-wide tooling without duplicating the detailed references.

## Routing

| Topic | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| Operator setup and first scan | [README.md](../README.md) |
| Current architecture, package boundaries, compatibility, and validation | [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md) |
| Environment variables, filenames, modes, and post-processing | [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md) |
| Images, host networking, Compose, builds, and publishing | [docs/deployment.md](../docs/deployment.md) |
| ScanSnap iX500 discovery, pairing, transport, and button behavior | [docs/protocol.md](../docs/protocol.md) |
| Real-hardware acceptance | [docs/swift-hardware-validation.md](../docs/swift-hardware-validation.md) |
| Completed Python-to-Swift migration evidence | [docs/history/swift-migration.md](../docs/history/swift-migration.md) |

## Current State And Scope

The Python-to-Swift service migration is complete. Read the current architecture document before
broad implementation changes. The historical migration record contains completed task lists and
must not be interpreted as work still to perform.

If a request's premise conflicts with the current tree, verify recent history and report the
mismatch before changing code. An unqualified cleanup is behavior-preserving and does not authorize
runtime redesign, public-API contraction, protocol changes, or replacement of working subsystems.

## Project shape

`scannerserver` is a Swift 6.3, Linux-first service packaged with SwiftPM and deployed as a multi-stage container image. `Sources/scannerserver` is the thin ArgumentParser entry point. `Sources/ScannerServerCore` owns the HTTP application, settings, document and preview operations, scan/OCR pipeline, ScanSnap networking, and long-lived runtime actors. Swift Testing coverage lives under `tests/ScannerServerCoreTests`.

The runtime implements ScanSnap acquisition and raw PDF assembly in Swift. It invokes native tools
for OCR, later PDF/image processing, metadata, and optional SANE compatibility. Treat those command
dependencies and the SwiftPM resource bundle as part of the container contract.

## Compatibility boundaries

Preserve the published image name, host-network assumptions, ports `80` and `8080`, arbitrary non-root UID/GID operation, the `/scans` volume, documented environment variables, persisted JSON schemas, output filenames, `.previews`, HTTP workflows, and ScanSnap protocol behavior unless a breaking change is explicitly authorized.

Hardware-dependent tests must remain opt-in. Do not infer protocol changes from unit tests alone; use the hardware checklist before publishing scanner-session, discovery, pairing, or button-runtime changes.

## Validation baseline

Run the checks appropriate to the changed layer:

```sh
swift build
swift test
docker build --tag scannerserver:local .
CONTAINER_COMMAND=docker ./scripts/smoke_swift_container.sh scannerserver:local
```

Documentation-only changes also require valid YAML front matter and resolvable local links. Container or hardware validation may be omitted only when the changed files cannot affect those layers; state the limitation explicitly.
